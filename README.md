# Polynomial Regression Program for Spring-Mass System
This project implements a polynomial regression algorithm to model and solve a simple spring-mass system. The project includes source code, example data, and a detailed report explaining the methodology and results.

Introduction
This project demonstrates the use of polynomial regression to analyze and solve a simple spring-mass system. The spring-mass system is a common physical system used to model oscillatory motion. By using polynomial regression, we aim to predict the behavior of the system based on given data points.

Features
Implementation of polynomial regression algorithm
Example data for a spring-mass system
Visualization of regression results
Detailed report explaining the algorithm and results
Installation
To set up this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:
sh
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/polynomial-regression-spring-mass.git
Navigate to the project directory:
sh
Copy code
cd polynomial-regression-spring-mass
Install the necessary dependencies (assuming the use of Python and pip):
sh
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Running the Code
The source code for the polynomial regression algorithm is provided in the main.py file. To run the code and solve the spring-mass system, execute the following command:

sh
Copy code
python main.py
Example Data
The example data for the spring-mass system is provided in the data directory. You can modify the data or use your own dataset by replacing the data.csv file.

Visualization
The program will generate plots to visualize the polynomial regression results. These plots will be saved in the output directory.

Report
A detailed report explaining the polynomial regression algorithm, the spring-mass system, and the results is provided in the report.docx file. Open the report using any compatible word processor.
